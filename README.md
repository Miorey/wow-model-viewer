# WoW Model viewer

This library allows eu to generate a 3d model character with his customization and items. It is
use [Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/) libraries to generate the rendering. This lib is made to work with WotLK (
WOW 3x) but with some little changes it should work on retail version.

## üõ† Requirements
To utilize this library effectively, you need a copy of specific files sourced from Wowhead. While there are various methods 
to obtain these files, this document demonstrates the use of a replica server.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: The gaming data belongs to Wowhead. It's recommended to use them for personal purposes or small-scale projects, and definitely not for large commercial endeavors.

### CORS policies
Bypass using a replica server. This lib calls the replica, which fetches files from the gaming repository.
For this purpose, you can use  [bypass-cors-policies](https://github.com/Miorey/bypass-cors-policies), which is specifically designed for such use cases. 
You can use it with docker or node.js.

#### üê≥ Using Docker
To run the replica server with docker use following `docker-compose.yml`
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  bypass-cors-policies:
    image: miorey/bypass-cors-policies:v1
    environment:
      - SERVER_NAME=https://wow.zamimg.com
    volumes:
      - ./storage:/usr/src/app/storage
    ports:
      - "2999:3000"
```

Run `docker-compose up`

#### Node.js
Alternatively, use Node.js for more details, refer to the: [doc](https://github.com/Miorey/bypass-cors-policies#local-setup).

### Additional library

This library depends on jQuery 3.x and the Wowhead ZamModelViewer. Ensure they're loaded in your HTML pages:

```html

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
        integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://wow.zamimg.com/modelviewer/live/viewer/viewer.min.js"></script>
```

### Setup

Lastly, you must set up the `CONTENT_PATH` environment variable. 
This indicates the location of the data required to render the canvas. 
If you're using the provided `docker-compose` example, then:

```js
    window.CONTENT_PATH = `http://localhost:2999/modelviewer/live/`
```

## Usage

The library can be used either be used in vanilla javascript and framework context

You have some usage examples [here](https://github.com/Miorey/wow-model-viewer/tree/examples/example)

### Framework

With a js framework add the requirements files in your main html file in my Vue.js example this refers to
`public/index.html`

Install the library with:

```bash
npm i wow-model-viewer
```

Import the lib

```js
import {generateModels} from 'wow-model-viewer';
```

In your html add the container of the model.

```html

<div id="model_3d"></div>
```

Call the lib

```JS
const character = {
    "race": 7,
    "gender": 1,
    "skin": 4,
    "face": 0,
    "hairStyle": 5,
    "hairColor": 5,
    "facialStyle": 5,
    "items": [[1, 1170], [3, 4925], [5, 9575], [6, 25235], [7, 2311], [8, 21154], [9, 14618], [10, 9534], [15, 17238], [21, 20379], [22, 28787]]
};
generateModels(1, `#model_3d`, character);
```

To have more explanation about the `character` json please refer to
[Advanced usage with items and transmogrification](./README.md)

### Start locally

You can simulate a web-server in your machine using `http-server`.

It's easy to install using npm:

```
npm install --global http-server
```

afterwards, you can run a webserver inside the project using:
```
http-server ./
```

### Vanilla JS

To load the character my beautiful female gnome warlock

```html

<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"
            integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0="
            crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://wow.zamimg.com/modelviewer/live/viewer/viewer.min.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="model_3d"></div>
</body>
<script type="module">
    import {generateModels} from './index.js';

    const character = {
        "race": 7,
        "gender": 1,
        "skin": 4,
        "face": 0,
        "hairStyle": 5,
        "hairColor": 5,
        "facialStyle": 5,
        "items": [[1, 1170], [3, 4925], [5, 9575], [6, 25235], [7, 2311], [8, 21154], [9, 14618], [10, 9534], [15, 17238], [21, 20379], [22, 28787]]
    };
    generateModels(1, `#model_3d`, character);
</script>
```

`./index.js` is the js file on the root level of this repository.

To have more explanation about the `character` json please refer to
[Advanced usage with items and transmogrification](./README.md)

### Advanced usage with items and transmogrification

The description of the character is

```json
{
    "race":7,
    "gender":1,
    "skin":4,
    "face":0,
    "hairStyle":5,
    "hairColor":5,
    "facialStyle":5,
    "items": [[1,1170],[3,4925],[5,9575],[6,25235],[7,2311],[8,21154],[9,14618],[10,9534],[15,17238],[21,20379],[22,28787]]
}
```

The `race` number refer to the following values

Race     | Number
:------: | :----:
human    | 1
orc      | 2
dwarf    | 3
nightelf | 4
scourge  | 5
tauren   | 6
gnome    | 7
troll    | 8
bloodelf | 10
draenei  | 11

The `gender` is `0` for female `1` for male.

The items is a 2 dimensional array the inner array contains the following values
`[ slot, display-id ]` the slot is the body part where the stuff is displayed.\
**Don't mismatch `display-id` and `item`** \
Ex for the following
item: [Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/item=22632/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian)
the `display-id` is `193838` to find it inspect. \
![View in 3D](https://miorey.github.io/wow-model-viewer/images//view_3d_wowhead.webp) \
For some items a new `display-id` is set for those items a new slot is made. This library manage those `display-id` so
basically you don't care.

Slot     |      Body       | Is displayed
:------: |:---------------:|:------------:
1        |      Head       |   Yes
2        |      Neck       |   No
3        |    Shoulders    |   Yes
4        |      Body       |   Yes
5        |      Chest      |   Yes
6        |      Waist      |   Yes
7        |      Legs       |   Yes
8        |      Feet       |   Yes
9        |     Wrists      |   Yes
10       |      Hands      |   Yes
11       |    Finger 1     |   No
12       |    Finger 2     |   No
13       |    Trinket 1    |   No
14       |    Trinket 2    |   No
15       |      Back       |   Yes
16       |    Main Hand    |   Yes
17       |    Off Hand     |   Yes
18       |     Ranged      |   Yes
19       |     Tabard      |   Yes
20       |   Chest (Robe)  |   Yes
21       | Main Hand (new) |   Yes
22       | Off Hand (new)  |   Yes

If you need that the library manage the search of the `display-id` based on our API and take in account player
transmogrification you can call it like following

```js

import {findItemsInEquipments, generateModels} from './index.js'

const character = {
    "race": 7,
    "gender": 1,
    "skin": 4,
    "face": 0,
    "hairStyle": 5,
    "hairColor": 5,
    "facialStyle": 5,
}
const equipments = [
    {
        "item": {
            "entry": 3075,
            "displayid": 15322
        },
        "transmog": {},
        "slot": 0
    }, {
        "item": {
            "entry": 2042,
            "displayid": 20379
        },
        "transmog": {
            "entry": 22632,
            "displayid": 193838
        },
        "slot": 15
    }];
findItemsInEquipments(equipments)
    .then(async e => {
        character.items = e;
        const model = await generateModels(1, `#model_3d`, character);
    });
```

In this case the `display-id` of the `transmog` will always replace the
`display-id` of the item.

### Manipulate view

Change character distance

```js
model.setDistance(2)
```

Fullscreen

```js
model.setFullscreen(false)
```

Change Animation
```js
model.setAnimation("Run")
```

Pause animation
```js
model.setAnimPaused(true)
```

Returns the list of all available animations
```js
model.getListAnimations()
```

Set animation angle to the zenith
```js
model.setZenith(Math.PI)
```

Set animation angle to the azimuth
```js
model.setAzimuth(Math.PI)
```

Remove any reference to the model object preventing **memory leak**
```js
model.destroy()
```

Change character items without reload the full view. (This works only for characters not for NPCs / creature)
```js
// paramters(slot, displayId, enchant)
model.updateItemViewer(1, 178278, 0)
```

Change character appearance without reloading:
```js
model.setNewAppearance({
    "skin": 4,
    "face": 0,
    "hairStyle": 5,
    "hairColor": 5,
    "facialStyle": 5,
})
```


### NPC and Items display

To display the npc and items you can call `generateModels` with:
- aspect (int)
- element selector (string)
- type and display id (object)

To get the npc display ids you can go [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=creature&build=9.2.5.42850#page=1&search=Arthas)

Prince of Lordaeron:
```js
const model = await generateModels(1, `#model_3d`, {type: 8, id: 24949});
```

To display Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian
```js
const model = await generateModels(1, `#model_3d`, {type: 1, id: 193841});
```
